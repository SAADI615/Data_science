Regression
1. Linear Regression: plot a line using data.
2. Decision Tree: use data like a tree.
3. Random Forest: reduce overfitting using more trees. the prediction will be all tree prediction average. (parallel way of learning)
4. ADA boost:  (sequential learning)
5. Gradient Boost:
6. XGB regression


Classifier:
1. Logistic Regression: (Predict probabilities)
2. KNearest Neighbor: Use neighbor
3. SVN: Drow line between y values.
4. XGB classifier: it is based on gradient boosting

Unsupervised Learning:
1. K-means clustering: 
2. Collaborative filtering: 


Data Balancing:
